Okay,

Add to this list as necessary and if the idea is yours, put in a description.

These are the ideas which we mentioned a second time after the weekend had passed.

Hotel Management Application -

Neighborhood Watch - Online Website where users are in groups with their neighbors. Possible alerts/notifications, calendar, and shared pages/discussions.

Trip to Germany - End project for all those in CSIS 2430. Use algorithms to determine the most effective to take a lengthy vacation through Germany with 20 or so stops.

RPG - 

Collin's CRM - 

Quote Book -
